        <p>Over the years I have mentored and taught under classmen to help them navigate their school life and
            assist with academic support.
        </p>
        <p>I have also spent the last 4 years or so volunteering for a local church, helping to teach little kids under 10 years old. I also work as a 
            Youth Leader in the High School of Fashio Industries as well as attended a Youth Advocacy class in the SYEP program in NYC.</p>
        <p>I have also participated in a work-based challenge in my software development major at Warby Parker. We learned 
            how to create prototypes and come up with ideas to make the user experience at their company more interactive and enjoyable.</p>
